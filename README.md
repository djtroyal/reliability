- Probability of failure P = ∫ f_stress(x) · F_strength(x) dx via numerical integration
- Supports all distribution types for both stress and strength

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the library
pip install -e .

# Install with dev dependencies (for running tests)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from reliability.Fitters import Fit_Weibull_2P, Fit_Everything
from reliability.Nonparametric import KaplanMeier
from reliability.SystemReliability import SeriesSystem, ParallelSystem
from reliability.FaultTree import BasicEvent, OrGate, FaultTree
import numpy as np

# Fit a Weibull distribution
failures = np.array([55, 92, 110, 145, 180, 220, 260])
fit = Fit_Weibull_2P(failures=failures, CI=0.95)
print(fit)  # Fit_Weibull_2P(alpha=..., beta=...)

# Confidence intervals on the parameters and bounds on the survival function
print(fit.results)                       # adds Standard Error / Lower CI / Upper CI columns
print(fit.alpha_lower, fit.alpha_upper)  # 95% CI for alpha
x, sf_lower, sf_upper = fit.confidence_bounds(func='SF')

# Fit all distributions and rank
fe = Fit_Everything(failures=failures)
print(fe.best_distribution_name)

# Kaplan-Meier
km = KaplanMeier(failures=failures)
print(km.results)

# Series system
s = SeriesSystem([0.99, 0.97, 0.95])
print(f"System reliability: {s.reliability:.4f}")

# Fault tree
a = BasicEvent("Pump A fails", 0.01)
b = BasicEvent("Pump B fails", 0.02)
top = OrGate("System failure", [a, b])
ft = FaultTree(top)
print(f"Top event probability: {ft.top_event_probability:.4f}")
print(f"Minimal cut sets: {ft.minimal_cut_sets}")
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests except slow ALT tests (~13 seconds)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_alt_fitters.py -q

# Full test suite including ALT (~15 minutes)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Web GUI

An interactive web GUI is included, built with FastAPI + React.

### Features
- **Life Data Analysis** — tabular data entry (ID / Time / State columns, Tab adds rows), CSV import and spreadsheet paste; multiple **folios** (sub-tabs) for independent analyses with a **Compare Folios** view (likelihood-ratio test + likelihood contour plots overlaid at multiple confidence levels, plus folio-vs-folio stress-strength interference using each folio's fitted distribution); enter data, specify a distribution by its parameters, or generate Monte Carlo samples; MLE/RRX/RRY fitting with manual confidence level entry, per-parameter CI tables, shaded confidence bands, and plots that update instantly when clicking through fitted distributions; Kaplan-Meier / Nelson-Aalen estimators; set-distribution selection; quick reliability calculator (R/F/f/h at time t); stress-strength interference tool
- **Accelerated Life Testing** — input failures and stress levels, select ALT models, view ranked results and an interactive life-stress plot; consolidated Test Planner: check non-parametric for Method 1, or fill in either available test time (solves samples) or sample size (solves test time) for the parametric Weibull methods, with options table and OC curve; acceleration factor calculator (Arrhenius, IPL, Eyring)
- **Failure Rate Prediction** — system hierarchy with **System Blocks** as nestable containers for piece parts (and other blocks), rendered as an indented, collapsible parts list with per-block λ subtotals; JSON import/export; all MIL-HDBK-217F part categories plus custom exponential/Weibull parts and per-part multipliers; inline part detail/edit panel with pi-factor breakdown; base method is always MIL-HDBK-217F with the ANSI/VITA 51.1 COTS supplement applied globally or overridden per part; contribution pie chart
- **System Reliability (RBD)** — drag-and-drop canvas: place component nodes, connect Source → components → Sink, edit reliabilities; computes system reliability, minimal path sets, and importance measures (Birnbaum, Criticality, RAW, RRW); auto-layout
- **Fault Tree Analysis** — drag-and-drop canvas: place AND/OR/VOTE/PAND/XOR/NOT/Transfer gates and basic events with SVG shapes, connect parent → child; computes top-event probability, minimal cut sets (click to highlight on diagram), and importance measures; auto-layout
- **Physics of Failure** — S-N curve fitting (Basquin's law), Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain curves, Larson-Miller creep life prediction, Miner's rule linear damage accumulation, LEFM fracture mechanics with Paris law crack growth, Coffin-Manson strain-life (low-cycle fatigue), Norris-Landzberg solder-joint thermal fatigue, Black's equation electromigration, Peck's temperature-humidity model, and Arrhenius thermal acceleration
- **Reliability Growth** — Crow-AMSAA (NHPP power law) and Duane model fitting from cumulative failure times entered manually or pulled from a Life Data folio; results summary with growth rate, cumulative and instantaneous MTBF; cumulative failures and MTBF vs time plots
- **Warranty Analysis** — full-width Nevada Chart data entry (editable upper-triangular shipment/return matrix with add/remove rows and columns); converts to life data; fits a distribution and forecasts expected future warranty returns per lot and period; forecast table and bar chart
- **Component/Event Library** — shared library in the RBD and FTA sidebars; auto-populated from LDA folios and prediction parts/groups; items snapshot a manual value, an LDA folio's fitted distribution, or a prediction part/group λ, and link to selected nodes by evaluating R (or 1−R) at a mission time
- **Projects** — named projects spanning all modules; project-level **time units** (hours, days, cycles, …) selected in the header and reflected on tables, results, and plot axes; import/export the whole project or a single module's data as JSON from the header bar; module state persists across tab switches and survives browser refresh (saved to localStorage)
- Export results as CSV

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python virtual environment with library installed (see Installation above)

### Running

```bash
bash gui/start.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

The start script launches:
- FastAPI backend on `http://localhost:8000`
- Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`

### CSV Format

Upload CSVs with two columns:

| value | type |
|-------|------|
| 100   | F    |
| 150   | F    |
| 200   | S    |

`type`: `F` = failure, `S` = suspension (right-censored). If the `type` column is omitted, all rows are treated as failures.
