# reliability

A fully-featured Python reliability engineering library with an interactive web GUI.

## Modules

### Life Data Analysis (`reliability.Fitters`)
- 13 distribution fitters: Weibull (2P/3P), Exponential (1P/2P), Normal, Lognormal (2P/3P), Gamma (2P/3P), Loglogistic (2P/3P), Beta, Gumbel
- MLE and Least Squares fitting
- Support for right-censored (suspended) data
- `Fit_Everything` — fits all distributions and ranks by AICc, BIC, or AD
- Goodness-of-fit metrics: AICc, BIC, Anderson-Darling

### Non-Parametric Estimators (`reliability.Nonparametric`)
- Kaplan-Meier survival estimator with Greenwood confidence intervals
- Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator

### Probability Plotting (`reliability.Probability_plotting`)
- Linearized probability plots for all supported distributions
- Supports censored data via rank adjustment (Bernard's approximation)

### Accelerated Life Testing (`reliability.ALT_fitters`)
- 24 ALT fitter classes: 6 life-stress models × 4 base distributions
- Life-stress models: Exponential (Arrhenius), Eyring, Power (IPL), Dual_Exponential, Power_Exponential, Dual_Power
- `Fit_Everything_ALT` — fits all applicable models and ranks by AICc or BIC

### System Reliability (`reliability.SystemReliability`)
- Series, Parallel, K-of-N, and Network (path-set) RBD configurations
- Nested block builder via `system_reliability_from_blocks`

### Fault Tree Analysis (`reliability.FaultTree`)
- AND, OR, and VOTE (k-of-n) gates with basic events
- MOCUS minimal cut set computation
- Importance measures: Birnbaum, Fussell-Vesely, RAW, RRW

## Installation

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the library
pip install -e .

# Install with dev dependencies (for running tests)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from reliability.Fitters import Fit_Weibull_2P, Fit_Everything
from reliability.Nonparametric import KaplanMeier
from reliability.SystemReliability import SeriesSystem, ParallelSystem
from reliability.FaultTree import BasicEvent, OrGate, FaultTree
import numpy as np

# Fit a Weibull distribution
failures = np.array([55, 92, 110, 145, 180, 220, 260])
fit = Fit_Weibull_2P(failures=failures)
print(fit)  # Fit_Weibull_2P(alpha=..., beta=...)

# Fit all distributions and rank
fe = Fit_Everything(failures=failures)
print(fe.best_distribution_name)

# Kaplan-Meier
km = KaplanMeier(failures=failures)
print(km.results)

# Series system
s = SeriesSystem([0.99, 0.97, 0.95])
print(f"System reliability: {s.reliability:.4f}")

# Fault tree
a = BasicEvent("Pump A fails", 0.01)
b = BasicEvent("Pump B fails", 0.02)
top = OrGate("System failure", [a, b])
ft = FaultTree(top)
print(f"Top event probability: {ft.top_event_probability:.4f}")
print(f"Minimal cut sets: {ft.minimal_cut_sets}")
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests except slow ALT tests (~13 seconds)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_alt_fitters.py -q

# Full test suite including ALT (~15 minutes)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Web GUI

An interactive web GUI is included, built with FastAPI + React.

### Features
- **Life Data Analysis** — paste or upload CSV data, select distributions, run MLE/LS fitting, view interactive probability plots and PDF/CDF/SF/HF curves; switch to Kaplan-Meier or Nelson-Aalen non-parametric estimators
- **Accelerated Life Testing** — input failures and stress levels, select ALT models, view ranked results and an interactive life-stress plot
- **System Reliability (RBD)** — drag-and-drop canvas: place component nodes, connect Source → components → Sink, edit reliabilities; computes system reliability and minimal path sets
- **Fault Tree Analysis** — drag-and-drop canvas: place AND/OR/VOTE gates and basic events, connect parent → child; computes top-event probability, minimal cut sets, and importance measures
- Export results as CSV

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python virtual environment with library installed (see Installation above)

### Running

```bash
bash gui/start.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

The start script launches:
- FastAPI backend on `http://localhost:8000`
- Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`

### CSV Format

Upload CSVs with two columns:

| value | type |
|-------|------|
| 100   | F    |
| 150   | F    |
| 200   | S    |

`type`: `F` = failure, `S` = suspension (right-censored). If the `type` column is omitted, all rows are treated as failures.
